            <h2 class="section-header">Greetings!</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Pete Wells and I am a software developer and graduate
              student in the Computer Science program at Portland State
              University. I began my journey here as a post-baccalaureate
              student with the goal to learn how to write great software. After
              working through the required undergrad, I've now began the
              master's program in hopes of gaining the knowledge that can help
              me pursue a career in software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also participating in an internship with
              <a href="https://www.nwea.org/" target="_blank"
                >Northwest Evaluation Association
              </a>
              (NWEA) as a back-end software developer. NWEA is a national
              company that helps evaluate student's progress in various subjects
              in school and generate reports to help guide their education. This
              is an issue I am passionate about as I believe there is a lot more
              we can be doing to promote education nationally.
              <span class="hide-text"
                >I have just began there, but the type of projects I will be
                working on involve migrating services to reduce overhead cost of
                operating such a large database and I am excited to work on an
                enterprise level project.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of the computer,
              <span class="hide-text"
                >you can find me participating in the Portland music scene in a
                variety of ways. </span
              >I like to make music at home, play drums in local bands across
              town and even work as an audio engineer from time to time. Beyond
              that, I am an avid gamer and plan on making some games of my own
              as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that software can be a powerful tool to enrich people's
              lives and help guide us to solutions to problems that may be
              otherwise impossible to discover. To that end, I have always had
              an interest in learning how software like this can be built, how
              it can interact with us in our lives, and am excited for the
              future.
