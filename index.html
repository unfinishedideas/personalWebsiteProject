        <p>
          Greetings! My name is Peter Wells and I am a graduate student in the
          Computer Science program at Portland State University. I began my
          journey here as a post-baccalaureate student to learn how to write
          great software. After working my way through the required undergrad,
          I've now began the master's program in hopes of gaining the knowledge
          that can help me pursue a career in software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from school, I am now participating in an internship with
          Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA) as a back-end software
          developer. NWEA is a national company that helps evaluate student's
          progress in various subjects in school and generate reports to help
          guide their education. This is an issue I am passionate about as I
          believe there is a lot more we can be doing to promote education
          nationally. I have just began there, but the type of projects I will
          be working on involve migrating services to reduce overhead cost of
          operating such a large database and I am excited to work on an
          enterprise level project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, you can find me participating in the Portland music
          scene in a variety of ways. I like to make music at home, play drums
          in local bands across town and have even worked as an audio engineer
          in the past. Beyond that, I am an avid gamer and plan on making some
          games of my own as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that software can be a powerful tool to enrich people's
          lives and help guide us to solutions to problems that may be otherwise
          impossible to discover. To that end, I have always had an interest in
          learning how software like this can be built, how it can interact with
          us in our lives, and am excited for the future.
        </p>
